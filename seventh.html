        The gems of Sri Lanka are woven into its history. Marco Polo wrote that
        the island had the best Sapphires, Topazes, Amethysts, and other
        gemstones in the world. Records from sailors that visited the island
        states that they brought back ‘Jewels of Serendib’. Serendib was the
        ancient name given to the island by Middle Eastern and Persian traders
        that crossed the Indian Ocean to trade gemstones from Sri Lanka to the
        East during the 4th and 5th century. King Solomon was said to have
        procured a great Ruby for the Queen of Sheba from Ceylon. In more recent
        times, the Sri Lankan Blue Sapphire glows in the universe due to the
        Royal Marriage of the Century. This glamorous Ceylon Blue Sapphire and
        Diamond Cluster is the engagement ring of the striking and admirable
        couple Prince William and Kate Middleton which was originally the
        engagement ring of the late Princess Diana.

        which is equivalent to 1,600,000 carats. The Queen of Asia was

        The Star of Adam is a blue star sapphire that has an oval shape and is
        currently recognized as the largest star sapphire in the world. It has a
        weight of 1,404.49 carats, which is equivalent to 280.898 grams or
        9.9084 ounces. The gemstone was discovered in 2015 and surpassed the
        Black Star of Queensland, which weighed 733 carats, as the largest star
        sapphire in the world.<br />
        The gemstone that is blue in color has a unique mark or reflection in
        the center that is shaped like a six-pointed star. This particular
        gemstone, which is known as "The Star of Adam," was discovered in August
        2015 in Ratnapura, a city in southern Sri Lanka that is famous for its
        abundance of precious gems. The current owner of the gemstone gave it
        this name as a reference to the belief held by Muslims that Adam, the
        first man, arrived in Sri Lanka and lived on Adam's Peak after being
        expelled from the Garden of Eden.

        The Chrysoberyl cat's eye is an exquisite gemstone that weighs a
        staggering 465 carats. It was discovered in the late 1800s in the
        Pelmadulla paddy field, located in the Rathnapura district of Sri Lanka.
        Originally, it belonged to a family that descended from King Rajasinghe
        the first, who ruled Sri Lanka from 1581 to 1593. This remarkable
        gemstone is found in the paddy fields owned by Iddamalgoda Kumarihamy,
        an aristocratic chieftain in the Sabaragamuwa Province and Chief
        Custodian of Saman Devale, a temple that has been serving the region for
        over 750 years.
