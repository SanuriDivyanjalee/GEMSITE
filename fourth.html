      <font color="#C61D20" face="Forte"><h1>Ruby</h1></font>
      <img src="images/ruby1.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        Ruby's distinctive red color results from the presence of chromium, and
        it is regarded as the most precious gemstone variant in the Corundum
        mineral species. The orange-red to purplish red color range of rubies
        may be found all over the world. The primary determinant of a ruby's
        worth is its color, which ranges from a bright, vivid red to a faintly
        purplish red in fine jewels.
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of Sri Lankan ruby variants exhibit a pinkish red color and
        a purple tinge as a result of the presence of iron in addition to
        chromium oxide, which is specific to the country of origin of this
        gemstone. Ruby deposits in Sri Lanka are not particularly specific; they
        are found in the same mine as other corundum-family jewels. However, the
        better-quality stones are frequently discovered in the
        Embilipitiya-Udawalawe region.
      </p>
      <font color="#270EAF" face="Forte"><h1>Sapphire</h1></font>
      <img src="images/sapphire.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        The color of a sapphire can range from blue through violet, green,
        yellow, orange, pink, purple, and intermediate colours known as fancy
        sapphires, but blue is the hue most commonly associated with
        sapphires.Sri Lanka is the world's leading exporter of the best Ceylon
        Sapphires, including Ceylon Blue Sapphire, Padparadscha, Star Sapphires,
        and a variety of Fancy Sapphires.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sapphires are not just pretty stones, they also have practical uses like
        infrared optical components, durable windows, wristwatch crystals,
        electronic parts, and insulating substrates for electronics like LED
        lights.
      </p>
      <font color="#551011" face="Forte"><h1>Garnet</h1></font>
      <img src="images/garnet.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        Garnet gems can be found in many different colors, except for blue.
        There are six different kinds of garnet gems: almandine, andradite,
        grossular, pyrope, spessartine, and uvarovite. Most types of Garnets can
        be found in Sri Lanka, except for andradite and uvarovite. They can have
        special features like asterism, chatoyancy, and a color change depending
        on the lighting.
      </p>
      All garnets have essentially the same crystal structure, but different
      chemical compositions. Garnet has more than 20 categories called species,
      but only five are of commercial importance as gemstones. Commercially
      valuable garnet varieties found in Sri Lanka
      include:Almandine,Grossular,Pyrope and Spessartine

          ><h1>Chrysoberyl(Cat's Eye)</h1></font
        >
        <img src="images/catseye.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though the term ‘Cat’s Eye’ is commonly used for various mineral
        species, the most coveted one is the rare gemstone belonging to the
        Chrysoberyl family. However, not all Chrysoberyls exhibit this distinct
        chatoyancy phenomenon. While transparent and translucent Chrysoberyls
        lacking a chatoyancy effect are quite widespread in Sri Lanka, cabochons
        of chatoyant chrysoberyls are cut to showcase their magnificent eyes,
        making them highly desirable in both local and global markets. The
        Chrysoberyl species of gemstones consist of two types, namely Cymophane
        and Alexandrite
      </p>
      <p>
        Chrysoberyl is found in various levels of transparency, ranging from
        clear and transparent to hazy, translucent, and opaque. It is widely
        spread across the primary gem-producing areas of the country, mainly
        concentrated around Rakwana, Bulutota, Deniyaya, Morawaka, Elahera,
        Avissawella, Pelawatte, Horana, Matugama, Panadura, Rathnapura,
        Aluthgama, Ambalantota, Agalawaththa, Bulathsinghala, Kalapugama and
        Mestiya. The shade of Cymophane or Cat’s Eye varies from
        semi-transparent golden-yellow to a slightly greenish-yellow or
        brownish-yellow.
      </p>
      <font color="#57B0F3" face="Forte"><h1>Aquamarine</h1></font>
      <img src="images/aqua.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        Aquamarine is often found completely flawless and has been discovered in
        various locations in Sri Lanka such as Rathnapura, Rakwana, Morawaka,
        Hatton, Nawalapitiya, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, and Lunugamwehera.
      </p>
      <p>
        Crystals of aquamarine are discovered in shades ranging from green-blue
        to blue and their blue tone is attributed to the presence of iron within
        the crystal. These crystals are comparatively large and well-formed,
        with the most intense depth of sea blue colour found in large specimens
        while smaller stones have a comparatively lighter colour. Aquamarine
        differs from other coloured gemstones in that its value is primarily
        determined by its tone rather than its hue and saturation, with stones
        possessing a darker tone being highly prized and sought after.
      </p>
      <font color="#7B32CB" face="Forte"><h1>Spinel</h1></font>
      <img src="images/spinel1.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        Nevertheless, natural spinel has always been a scarce and stunning
        gemstone. Sri Lanka is the world's second-largest provider of spinel to
        the global gem and jewelry industry, with hues ranging from ruby red,
        pink, orange, reddish-brown, purple, blue, bluish-green, mauve,
        greenish-black, black, and colorless. Natural blue spinel that is
        colored by cobalt has been discovered in Sri Lanka. Cobalt spinel has
        been found in Ratnapura, Okkampitiya, and Embilipitiya. In addition to
        the common spinel varieties, there are also varieties known as
        Ceylonite, Gahnite, and Ghanospinel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Plentiful, appealing, reasonably priced, and vivid spinels are
        accessible in red, pink, and blue hues and infrequently showcase
        asterism and chatoyancy. Spinels are a type of gemstone that can be
        found in large quantities in Sri Lanka, and prior to the emergence of
        modern gemology in the 19th and 20th centuries, spinels were frequently
        misidentified as Corundums since they were primarily discovered in the
        same mines. Further investigation into the mineral composition of these
        two gem families resulted in their differentiation, and many gem
        enthusiasts discovered that their beloved rubies and sapphires were
        indeed spinels.

      <font color="#7488DE" face="Forte"><h1>Moonstone</h1></font>
      <img src="images/moonstone.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        Moonstones are a valuable gemstone that falls into the Feldspar category
        of minerals and are renowned for their enchanting radiance brought about
        by adularescence. The Meetiyagoda mines located in Sri Lanka are where
        the highly regarded Blue Moonstones are found. Traditional moonstones
        are fashioned into cabochons, but there are variations that display a
        cat's eye effect or a four-pointed star alongside the usual rippling
        play of light. These stones are not only crafted into cabochons but also
        into artistic cameos or etched with intricate designs.
      </p>
      <font color="#9215E6" face="Forte"><h1>Amethyst</h1></font>
      <img src="images/amethyst.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        A violet type of the crystal quartz, the supreme amethyst hue is intense
        reddish-purple to purple with no noticeable hue zoning. Tinted by Iron,
        the tones of Amethyst appear in translucent muted pinks to profound
        purples. Similar to numerous other precious stones, the standard of
        Amethyst fluctuates depending on its origin. The most exceptional types
        of amethyst can be discovered in Siberia, Sri Lanka, Brazil and the
        remote East.
      </p>
      <font color="#D9B615" face="Forte"><h1>Tourmaline</h1></font>
      <img src="images/tourmaline.jpg" height="185" width="270" />
      <p>
        Tourmaline, which can be found in all the hues of the rainbow, possesses
        a highly intricate mineral composition that accounts for its vivid
        colouration. The Tourmaline variety of gemstones originating from Sri
        Lanka exhibits a range of colours from yellow-green to a brilliant
        green. Among the significant Tourmaline gemstones discovered in Sri
        Lanka, the blends of Dravite and Uvite are highly prized. These species
        typically display shades of brown, yellow-brown, reddish-brown or almost
        black, and contain traces of vanadium, chromium, or both.
