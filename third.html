		Sri Lanka has been famous for its high-quality and diverse gemstones for more than 2,500 years, making them the country's most prominent and valuable mineral resource. The gemstone deposits are located in a narrow geological zone, and recent geological surveys have revealed that the potential for gemstones is approximately 50% higher than previously estimated. As a result, many new gem fields have been discovered in the central highlands and southwestern geological formations. Gem minerals are obtained from eluvial, alluvial, and residual formations.

		<p>Gem mining is a prevalent activity in various parts of Sri Lanka, including environmentally sensitive areas. However, mining in such areas can lead to severe environmental and morphological issues. Hence, it is crucial to seek mining consultancy services in such cases. The National Gem and Jewellery Authority (NGJA) offers consultancy services provided by Mining Engineers, Geologists, and Environmental Officers.

The miners are always instructed to properly handle effluent water from the gravel washing machine. This involves treating the water to remove silt and mud by using sedimentation tanks and silt traps. To further minimize water pollution caused by silt and mud, a technique of circulating effluent water through a series of sedimentation ponds has been introduced. After extracting gem gravel, existing pits can be repurposed as sedimentation ponds which will automatically refill.</p>

		The Kalu Ganga river drains the Sabaragamuwa catchment, which has an area of around 4,500 square kilometers. This region experiences heavy rainfall and is prone to severe flooding during the wet seasons. The gem fields of Sabaragamuwa extend to smaller areas in the Western and Southern provinces. These regions have a long history of gem mining that spans centuries. However, recent mining activity in the upper reaches of the Menik Ganga near Buttala and Okkampitiya in the Uva province, as well as in the Elahera area in the Matale district of the Central Province, suggests that gem-bearing areas are not limited to the southwest sector of the island.

		The Nuwara Eliya basin, the Horton Plains, Maskeliya, and the Kandy district are among other locations that have previously yielded gemstones. However, moonstones are an exception as they are obtained from partly altered pegmatites near Ambalangoda. All other types of gemstones are extracted from alluvial deposits of rivers and streams or abandoned channels that drain regions containing crystalline rocks that bear gems.
