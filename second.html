        Gem jewellery is a type of jewellery that features precious or
        semi-precious gemstones. Gemstones are minerals that have been cut and
        polished to be used in jewellery. Some of the most popular gemstones
        used in jewellery include diamonds, rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and
        pearls. Gemstone jewellery can come in a variety of forms, including
        necklaces, bracelets, earrings, and rings. The value of gemstone
        jewellery is often determined by the rarity and quality of the gemstones
        used.<br /><br />

        Gemstone jewellery has been worn for centuries and has been associated
        with wealth, power, and status. In ancient times, gemstones were

        amulets. Today, gemstone jewellery is still highly valued for its beauty
        and symbolism. Diamonds are often associated with love and commitment,
        while rubies are associated with passion and courage.<br /><br />

        Gemstone jewellery can be found in a variety of styles to suit different
        tastes and occasions. Some people prefer classic designs that feature a
        single gemstone set in gold or silver, while others prefer more modern
        designs that incorporate multiple gemstones or unique settings.<br /><br />

        Overall, gemstone jewellery is a timeless and valuable addition to any
        collection. Whether you're looking for a special gift or a statement

        Nawaratna gemstones are a combination of nine different gemstones that
        are believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and happiness to the
        wearer. The nine gemstones include diamond, ruby, emerald, blue
        sapphire, yellow sapphire, hessonite, cat's eye, pearl, and coral.
        According to traditional Hindu astrology, each of these gemstones
        represents a planet and wearing them together in a specific arrangement
        can balance the energies of the planets and bring positive effects to
        the wearer's life. Nawaratna jewelry is popular in South Asian countries
        such as Srilanka and India and is often worn as a talisman or amulet for
        good fortune.

        Birthstones are gemstones that are associated with a person's birth
        month. Each month has a specific gemstone assigned to it, and wearing
        one's birthstone is said to bring good luck and protection. The concept
        of birthstones dates back to ancient times, with the first recorded use
        of them being in the Bible. Over time, different cultures have assigned
        different gemstones to each month, but the modern list of birthstones
        was standardized by the National Association of Jewelers in 1912.
        <br /><br />The list includes:<br />
        Garnet for January<br />
        Amethyst for February<br />
        Aquamarine for March<br />
