                Sri Lanka, also known as the "pearl of the Indian Ocean," has
                been renowned for centuries for its abundance of stunning
                gemstones. Traders from all over the world would stop at this
                magical land during their voyages in search of the world's
                finest gemstones. Historical records show that royalty from
                various countries, including the English Royal Family, have
                adorned their crown jewels with gems and jewelry from Sri Lanka.
                The brilliance of Sri Lankan gemstones has inspired kings,
                traders, and historians throughout history. Even today, Sri
                Lanka remains a top producer of world-class gemstones. In
                ancient times, Sri Lanka was referred to as "Rathna Dweepa,"
                which means "The Island of Gemstones.

                Sri Lanka is a country that possesses the highest density of
                gemstone deposits in the world. The landmass spans across 65,000
                square kilometers, out of which 80% has been undisputedly
                declared as 'Potential Gem Bearings.' Sri Lanka produces over 75
                varieties of gemstones out of around 200 known gemstone
                varieties. The main species of gemstones found in Sri Lanka are
                Sapphire, Ruby, Cat's Eye, Alexandrite, Chrysoberyl, Spinel,
                Topaz, Zircons, Tourmaline, and Garnets. These gemstones occur
                mainly in alluvial gravels found in valley bottoms into which
                flow tributary hillside streams that carry gem minerals released
                by weathering from the bedrock sources located at hilltops or
                hillsides. Some rocks have also been shown to contain gemstones,
                particularly varieties of Corundum. There are also gemstones
                associated with pegmatite which constituted an important source.
